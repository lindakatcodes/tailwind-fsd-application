      <br>I'm Linda, and I'd like to be your next full stack developer.</h1>

      <h2>Here's a quick rundown of why I'd be a good fit for your team:</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-6 ml-4 lg:ml-8">
        <li>I <strong>love</strong> JavaScript - there's so much you can do with it! It ties in logic with
          functionality and
          allows us to craft so many cool interactions. And there's so many flavors of it! There's always something to
          learn
          with it, and it's still growing and evolving.</li>
        <li>I love playing with designs, and creating them with CSS. I'm still in the Ira Glass "first few years
          gap"
          part of my journey, where I can recognize good design but have a hard time creating it myself. But I keep
          practicing and working towards developing my taste.</li>
        <li>In my life, I've always been happiest working behind the scenes, doing things that allow other people to
          shine. So working on a project like Tailwind would be ridiculously amazing.</li>
        <li>You'll need someone for this position who can get up to speed with where you currently are, and then grow
          with
          you into the future you want. As a self taught developer, I've
          had to delve into things I didn't understand yet, learn quickly, and use that knowledge to move forward.
          Exactly the mentality you'll need for someone in this role.</li>
        <li>As someone fresh in the field, I'm also a clean slate - I'm ready and willing to be molded into a role. I
          don't come with many pre-determined biases on how things should be done, which will help me be more open to
          ideas
          and see things from a new perspective. This will come in handy when prototyping ideas and working out
          refactoring problems.</li>
        <li>With a customer service background, I'll be able to easily jump in and help with the support aspects.</li>
        <li>I love puzzles. I play solitaire and do JS algorithm problems for fun. They require patience, determination,
          and an ability to see a situation from multiple angles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A quick timeline of my developer history:</h2>
      <ul class="space-y-6">
        <li><span class="font-bold text-xl">2020 (so far)</span>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-6 ml-4 mt-3 lg:ml-8 lg:mt-6">
            <li>I decided to dig into my first framework, and started with Vue! I've been working
              through
              the intro courses on Vue Mastery and Vue School, digging into the docs, and am currently building my first
              real project with it. I've also been able to go back in and update my blog, now that I understand more of
              how
              Vue works. It's been a really fun framework to get into!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-bold text-xl">2019</span>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-6 ml-4 mt-3 lg:ml-8 lg:mt-6">
            <li>I decided I wanted to dig more into the back end world, and so spent the year working through
              a
              course on Node. We covered Node itself, MongoDB, Express, and slew of other helper programs to build out
              API's, and learn a bit about connecting a back end to a front end. I also attended my first developer
              conference (DFW Dev Fest)!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-bold text-xl">2018</span>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-6 ml-4 mt-3 lg:ml-8 lg:mt-6">
            <li>I heard about a challenge program with Grow with Google, for a free Udacity nanodegree
              program. I
              applied, and got it! We did a 3 month trial program, and then they picked 1,000 students from each track
              to
              continue on with the full nanodegree. And I was selected again! So I spent the year working on this in
              depth
              program built around mobile web development, learning all about responsive design, accessibility, and
              helping
              programs work without internet. I made friends, learned a bunch, & framed the graduation certificate I
              got.

          <ul class="list-disc space-y-6 ml-4 mt-3 lg:ml-8 lg:mt-6">
            <li>I stumbled upon an email series called Daily CSS, where you get a prompt for something to draw
              each day for a month. I did the intro example, and loved the idea of being able to draw with CSS! So I
              signed
              up. I haven't done all of them yet, but I did get my most popular CodePen pen from this challenge - Hobbes
              the
              tiger!</li>
            <li>I also completed my first round of 100 days of code!</li>
            <li>Around this same time, I started building small projects at the company I was working for. It started
              with a
              simple form for a customer to send us order requests. Then a form to use myself to track delivery invoice
              numbers. And then I created the project I was most excited for - an inventory tracking site for stamp
              supplies. I had studied a bit about databases but had yet to get one to work successfully - the knowledge
              just
              wasn't there yet. But finally, I persevered and was able to get this site connected to a Google Sheet &
              updating to changes! I can't explain how proud I was.</li>

          <ul class="list-disc space-y-6 ml-4 mt-3 lg:ml-8 lg:mt-6">
            <li>I wanted a career change, & decided to try out
              programming.
              So I started with Harvard's CS50
              course, on edX. It was challenging, but I enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>I definitely wanted to learn more, but wasn't real impressed with the look of my final
              project.
              So I decided to focus a bit more on front end skills, & found freeCodeCamp. What a game changer! This is
              where
              I first dove into HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this daily advent calender of programming puzzles called
              Advent of Code.
              I loved the idea & decided to try it out - & what a blast it was! There was a lot I couldn't do on my own
              that
              year, but the community was so helpful & I learned a TON through seeing everyone's solutions.</li>

      <h2>Final Notes</h2>

      <p>I'll be honest with you - there aren't any specific tools, languages, or projects that I'm super excited about.
        This industry is so broad and covers so many variations of things - I haven't been able to devote a lot of
        energy
        into fully keeping up with everything, outside of what I've needed to learn.</p>

      <p>What I <em>am</em> excited about in this field is all of the possibility. I love the growing vulnerability and
        openness I see
        from folks. I love that so many people can find voids in niche spaces and build something to fill it. I love
        that
        even if something already exists to solve the problem you're facing, if you don't like how it does it you can
        build
        something different but similar, and still do well.</p>

      <p>There's so much possibility for growth and expression of self in this field. And it's becoming more welcoming
        for
        folks from all walks of life. I know that if I get an idea for something I want to
        build,
        there's tools and projects out there that can help. And if not, I can find a way to assemble pieces that will
        let
        me
        create it myself, and share it for others who might also want the same thing. That's not something you can say
        for
        a
        lot of other fields, and it's refreshing.</p>

      <p>I am still new to a lot of this field, and there would be some onboarding and growing that I'd need to get up
        to
        speed with your projects and skills. The pair programming and regular conversation would be a huge benefit. It
        might
        be tempting for some to think that taking a chance on someone so new would slow things down, more than speed
        them
        up.</p>

      <p>While I can't promise what I don't know, here's what I can tell you. I will throw myself into this completely,
        and
        do
        everything I can to fully understand my role and this project, so I can be an asset for you. I might not have
        the
        tech specific knowledge to hit the ground running, but what I do have is a skill set that allows me to pick
        things
        up quickly, to figure out the right questions to ask when something doesn't work, and a resilience to keep going
        until I get it right. My personality is easy to get along with, and I rarely cause issues. Given a clear goal,
        I'll be able to work faster than some might think to
        craft beautiful, helpful things. All I need is a chance.</p>
